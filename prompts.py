        "behavior, type mismatches, and unhandled exceptions."
    ),
    "Performance": (
        "Focus on performance and efficiency: algorithmic complexity, redundant "
        "work, unnecessary allocations, N+1 queries, blocking I/O, caching "
        "opportunities, and hot-path optimizations."
    ),
    "Security": (
        "Focus on security: injection risks, unsafe deserialization, secrets in "
        "code, weak crypto, missing input validation, auth/authz gaps, and unsafe "
        "handling of untrusted data. Reference OWASP categories where relevant."
    ),
    "Best Practices": (
        "Evaluate against idiomatic conventions for the language: naming, error "

        "idioms."

    "Clean Architecture": (
        "Assess architecture and design: separation of concerns, layering, "
        "coupling and cohesion, dependency direction, SOLID principles, and "
        "testability of the design."

    "Refactoring": (
        "Identify concrete refactoring opportunities: duplicated logic, long "

        "highest-impact structural improvements."

Rules:
- Every array must be present; use an empty array [] when there are no findings.
- Be specific and reference concrete lines or symbols from the submitted code.
- Do not invent issues; if the code is clean in an area, return an empty array.
- Keep the refactored_code faithful to the original language and intent.
